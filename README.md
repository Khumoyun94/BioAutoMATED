# BioSeq-AutoML
Automated machine learning for analyzing, interpreting, and designing biological sequences.

# Abstract
Technical hurdles in machine learning (ML), such as model design choices, constitute formidable barriers to entry for many biological domain experts. While automated machine learning (AutoML) can circumvent several of the challenges in applying ML to the life sciences, these algorithms are rarely used in molecular biology studies because they typically do not explicitly handle biological sequences (e.g., nucleotide, protein, glycan sequences) and cannot be easily compared with other AutoML algorithms. Here, we present BioSeq-AutoML, an AutoML platform tailored for biological sequence analysis that integrates multiple AutoML methods into a unified and customizable framework. Users are automatically provided with relevant biological techniques for analyzing, interpreting, and designing biological sequences. We benchmark our platform on nucleic acid, peptide, and glycan datasets. Notably, BioSeq-AutoML produces ML models in a matter of hours with comparable performance to previously reported, manually-tuned models, offering a valuable resource for biologists with limited ML experience.
