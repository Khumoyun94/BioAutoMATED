# BioSeq-AutoML
Automated machine learning for analyzing, interpreting, and designing biological sequences.

# Abstract
Technical hurdles in machine learning (ML), such as model design choices, constitute formidable barriers to entry for many biological domain experts. While automated machine learning (AutoML) can circumvent several challenges in applying ML to the life sciences, these algorithms are rarely used in systems biology studies because they typically do not explicitly handle biological sequences (e.g., nucleotide, protein, glycan sequences) and cannot be easily compared with other AutoML algorithms. Here, we present BioSeq-AutoML, an AutoML platform tailored for biological sequence analysis that integrates multiple AutoML methods into a unified, customizable framework. Users are automatically provided with relevant techniques for analyzing, interpreting, and designing biological sequences. We benchmark our platform with published datasets and conduct an end-to-end case study using BioSeq-AutoML to answer key questions in diagnostic development. Notably, BioSeq-AutoML produces models with comparable performance to previously reported, manually-tuned models, offering a valuable resource for life scientists with limited ML experience.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
